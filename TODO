plans:

maybe add cli args for these:
listerene -m [mode] -i [input filepath] -o [database filepath] [-h|--help] 
[-v|--version]

may need to add scrolling menu for extra choices

make gui nicer

add .cfg file to save/create custom charsets.

update signal() call to sigaction()

look into timer bug (timer derps when processing hundreds of strings/second)

fix function flow on sort mode repeat(major bug)

make organized sort and simple sort modes.(maybe)

warn if run as root

Fix speed problems for 1.0.

Random ideas to speed things up:

Use sqlite3

Add multithreading

Use hash tables


BUGS:

timer derps when sorting goes super-fast.
infinite-loop program flow broken.
Faster than ever, but still slow as bollocks in grand scheme of things.
