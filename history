Pre-0.1  Started as a simple one-function script with filepaths and charsets hardcoded, quickly grew to allow user input and became a multi-function program.  Eventually decided it would be nice to get fancy with it and release it for the public.

0.1 - Became a solid standard terminal app, charset compare kinda borked, but it all works, though fairly simple.  Using plain strcmp() makes things slow with huge password collections.

0.2, ported to ncurses, many new bugs and kinks, but works for basics

0.3, 
custom mode fixed
ncurses setup fixed
charset compare fixed
added ctrl+c handling
added resize handling.

0.4 
updated charset definitions, lengths
added over 10% efficiency with a single line of code!
renamed variables to meet half-decent standards
forked into 2-d array version, amazingly buggy, not fast, scrapped it

0.5
Added strip feature
Wrote proper help file
Added help-file display feature
battled with variable-screen-size word-wrap for days!
vanquished a horde of new bugs
switched to infinite-looping OOP-style function flow(borked)
Added runtime clock feature
added more efficiency to main loop by reducing if's

tried using SQL and turning database into a linked list, didn't work well.

---------------
I wrote this app years ago and never published it.  I am publishing it now in hopes that it helps someone in the future.  If I have time and motivation, I hope to come back to it later and improve it.  Enjoy.
